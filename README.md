## Dichoptic Visual Stimulation Experiment Protocol

### Background

Dichoptic viewing consists of presenting two different stimuli to each eye independently. In other words, a certain stimulus A is presented to the right eye and a stimulus B is shown to the left. 

Dichoptic visual training is often used as a treatment method for patients with amblyopia (lazy eye), a disease that causes patients to have reduced vision in one eye. Since one eye is weaker than the other, the training helps the patients learn how to use both of their eyes at the same time. The most common amblyopia training is red/green viewing which is the basis of this experiment.

### Methods

In this experiment, the patient wears a pair of glasses with a red lens over their right eye and a green lens over their left. They are then shown an image with random patching patterns; as the image is divided into blocks, some of these blocks will be green, others will be red (see figure below). Depending on their amblyotic eye, the patient should usually be able to discern the blocks in one color better than the other. Why? Because the right eye viewing through the red lens will not be able to see the blocks with the green filter as it will mostly be black; and conversely, the left eye viewing through the green lens will not be able to see the blocks with the red filter. Each eye will only be able to see the blocks the same color of their lens. 

**Therefore, in order to completely view the image, the amblyotic participant must use both of their eyes together.**

After the presentation of the image, the participant is asked to categorize the image just seen in one of the following categories : **animals, nature, human, city or objects.**

This task is then repeated 10 times for each of the 9 conditions : 1) 10 blocks presented to normal eye 2) 20 blocks ... until 9) 90 blocks. As the number of blocks presented to the normal eye increases, it should become easier for the participant to categorize the image. 

***The goal is to see the psychometric function threshold for an accurate categorization of a randomly presented dichoptic image in amblyotic patients.***
